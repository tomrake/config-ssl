#+TITLE: My Configuation of ssl dlls for cl+ssl

CL+SSL/config allow CL+SSL to be used to configure the location of the .dll files are needed.
The config model should be available for all crossplatform external libs, CL+SSL/config is a working example.

CL+SSH has a configuration package CL+SSH/config which exports the macros
- (define-libssl-path "a path")
- (define-libcrypto-path "another path")

This allows the location of the external libraries to be deterimined by the programmer.

I use the MSYS64 installation on my computer for CL+SSL library locations on Windows 11.

Other possibilities
- distribute custom or older version to bypass the OS default version.
- have the external library located within the source distribution.
- conditionally have the library choose a file based on the execution enviroment, windows, linux or mac.
- reference a known reference location when the system has been droped as an image.
