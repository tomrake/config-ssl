A well designed and considered central storage mechanism can help organize external libraries.

# The Vision

You have a store


While this mechanism was designed for Common Lisp there is no reason that any program in any language cannot benifit from an organized store of external libraries.

## Name and version of software library products.

This propoal is to have a series of directories with names of software product and version.

## OS and Hardware abbreviattion

In side the library name and version folders are subfolders with names such as Linux-x32-64 and Windows-i386 and similar names.

# Agree on a naming convention

A  product that needs to use a shared library know which OS it is running under and what hardware it is running on.
